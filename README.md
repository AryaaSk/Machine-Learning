## KNN Iris
This is a demo project to learn about the K Nearest Neighbour algorithm, I use data about different types of Irises, and test it with some sample data.

KNN is a classification algorithm.

It works by plotting all the data on a scatter graph, then when you input some new data, it checks the K nearest points to that 1 data point, then it detects which one it is by whichever class has the highest frequency in the K points.

It can also use 3D spaces, however to keep the demo simple I have just used it on a 2D space, the number of dimensions is the number of attributes which you compare (each attribute is plotted on a plane).
